# Dataset Preparation Best Practices

Guidelines for preparing datasets for fine-tuning models

## Supported File Formats

Our platform supports datasets in two formats:

- CSV (.csv)
- JSON Lines (.jsonl)

## Format Specifications

### CSV Format

Your CSV dataset should contain exactly two columns:

1. **input**: This column should include the text input data.
2. **expected_output**: This column should contain the corresponding expected output or response.

Example:

```csv
input,expected_output
"What is AI?","Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines."
"Define machine learning.","Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to perform tasks without explicit instructions."
```

### JSON Lines Format

We support two types of JSON Lines (.jsonl) formats, depending on your use case:

#### a. Completion Format

Ideal for text completion tasks where the model generates text based on a prompt.

Keys:

- `prompt`: The text prompt you want the model to respond to.
- `completion`: The desired output or completion you expect from the model.

Example:

```json
{"prompt": "What is the capital of France?", "completion": "Paris."}
{"prompt": "Explain photosynthesis.", "completion": "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to convert light energy into chemical energy."}
```

#### b. Chat Template

Use this format for chat-based datasets with multiple conversational exchanges between roles.

Key:

- `messages`: Contains a list of message objects, each with a role and content.

Roles:

- `system`: Defines initial instructions or context for the conversation.
- `user`: Represents the user's input.
- `assistant`: Represents the model's response.

Example:

```json
{"messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "That's funny! Do you know any puns?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was wondering why the baseball was getting bigger. Then it hit me."}
]}
```

## Data Formatting Guidelines

- **Consistent Structure**: Ensure that all entries in your dataset follow the specified format without deviation.
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Use UTF-8 encoding to support a wide range of characters and symbols.
- **No Missing Fields**: Every entry should include all the required fields (input and expected_output for CSV, or the necessary keys for JSONL formats).

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Remove Noise**: Eliminate irrelevant content, typos, special characters, and duplicate entries.
- **Normalize Text**: Standardize text formatting (e.g., consistent capitalization, punctuation).
- **Spell Check**: Correct spelling errors to improve data quality.

## Ensuring Data Quality and Diversity

- **Relevance**: Include data that is directly related to your AI use case to enhance model effectiveness.
- **Diversity**: Incorporate a variety of examples to help the model generalize better across different inputs.
- **Balanced Representation**: For tasks like classification, ensure all classes are adequately represented.

## Handling Special Cases

- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Use the Chat Template in JSONL format for datasets involving dialogues or multiple interactions.
- **Long Texts**: If dealing with long inputs or outputs, ensure they are properly formatted and do not exceed any platform-specific length limitations.

## Data Privacy and Compliance

- **Anonymization**: Remove or mask any personally identifiable information (PII) in your dataset to protect individual privacy.
- **Compliance**: Ensure your data collection and usage comply with relevant laws and regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, etc.


## Tips for Successful Dataset Preparation

- **Start Small**: Begin with a smaller subset of your data to validate formatting and upload processes.
- **Validate Format**: Use tools or scripts to check the JSON or CSV format before uploading.
- **Sample Review**: Manually review a sample of your dataset entries to catch any errors early.
