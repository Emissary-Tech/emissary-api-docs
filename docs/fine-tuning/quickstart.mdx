## Overview
Once you have a clear idea of your AI use-case, you'll want to develop systems that 'adapt' to your specific needs.
This can be achieved through finetuning your own AI models. At its core, all AI is about matrix multiplication, expressed by the simple equation **Ax = y** where **A** is your AI model weights, **x** your input and **y** output.
In the case of prompting, we modify **x**, having no control over **A**. In finetuning, you modify and control **A**, allowing greater control and stability over your AI.
Finetuning allows you to be more than just another prompt wrapper and have differentiated AI capabilities. 

See [Finetuning your first AI model](#finetuning-your-first-ai-model) to get started, or learn more about each stage by clicking on a card below


## Finetuning your first AI model

### **1. Create Model Service**
Click **Model Services** on the services panel and then **+ NEW SERVICE** button in the dashboard.
![model_services](/img/quickstart/model_services.png)
### **2. Enter Model Service Name** <br></br>
  In the pop-up, enter a new model service name, and click **CREATE**.

The shortest path to finetuning a model is by clicking **+NEW TRAINING JOB**, naming the output model, picking a backbone &#40;base model&#41;, selecting the training dataset &#40;you must have uploaded it in the step before&#41;, and finally hitting **START NEW TRAINING JOB.** )

[//]: # (  You can optionally upload a test data set too. )

[//]: # (  Once you select a model, you will also be able to see and modify advanced **Hyper Parameters** such as number of epochs, learning rate, batch size and downsample size. )

[//]: # (  <br></br>Furthermore, you also have the option to control and customize your own **Training Script and Testing Script**. )

[//]: # (  <br></br>To test on a random fraction of your data, simply change downsample size to the relevant percentage &#40;10 —> training on 10% of data&#41;. By default, values are set to help you have the highest probability of successful outcome.)
